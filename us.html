<p>AS EVIDENT FROM THE RESULTS TILL NOW , A BIDEN VICTORY SEEMS LIKE A MERE FORMALITY. ARIZONA,MICHIGAN AND WISOCNSIN ARE ALL GONE OUT OF TRUMP"S HAND.A VICTORY IN NEVADA(WHICH IS A SURE THING NOW) WILL SEAL THE DEAL FOR BIDEN.BUT IS THIS VICTORY REALLY THE KIND OF VICTORY THE DEMOCRATS WANTED ? IS EVERYTHING LOST FOR THE CONSERVATIVES ? THE ANSWER IS HELL NO ! THIS RESULT HAS ONLY BOOSTED THE MORALE OF THE RIGHT LEANING TRUMPISTS. THE LANDSLIDE VICTORY PREDICTED BY THE POLLS SEEMS LIKE THEY WERE SELLING DREAMS TO THE LIBERALS. BUT THEY HAD TO WAKE UP FROM THAT DREAM ON THE 4TH OF NOVEMBER WHEN TRUMP MADE THEM SWEAT FOR EACH AND EVERY SEAT.ALSO ,THE REPUBLICANS STILL OWN THE SENATE . MITCH MCONNELL WILL STILL BE A PAIN IN THE ASS FOR BIDEN. ALSO ,THE FACT THAT THIS VICTORY WAS POSSIBLE ONLY BECAUSE OF THIS CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC WILL CONTINUE TO  HAUNT THE LIBERALS . THIS NARROW ESCAPE FOR BIDEN DOESN'T REALLY SHOW THE BIG PICTURE.THE CONSERVATIVE BASE IS AS STRONG AS EVER AND IS BOOMING AGAIN. THE MEDIA OUTLETS AND THE HOLLYWOOD STILL HAS NO EFFECT ON VOTERS.ITS A WIN FOR THE CONSERVATIVES WHO WERE DOWNPLAYED BY THE MEDIA AND SELF ENTITLED CELEBRITIES AMD THEY WILL RISE AGAIN!
